Lab 1: setup GitHub and server

Lab 2: wrote up resume in HTML

Lab 3: reorganized website according to my information architecture outline

I chose to put my IntroITWS directory within a classes directory in the case that
I need to host something online for another class.
I decided on a navigation bar with dropdown tabs because I was inspired by the
Google bookmarks system, which I use every day and find very simple and elegant.


**List of websites that I've taken inspiration from:**

My dropdown CSS code was inspired by the example from here:
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp

I learned how to make custom list styles from here:
