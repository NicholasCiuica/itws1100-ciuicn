In this lab, I used AJAX to dynamically generate a list of lab links in my labs page.

I have a JSON file within the lab 8 folder that is read using JS file in the same folder using AJAX. This JS file then makes a DOM object using JQuery and the info from the JSON file, which is inserted into a content div in the labs HTML page.

I used JQuery to add some customizable tooltips to content blocks in labs.html and lab08/index.html.
